# Angular-Node-Crypto-Tax-Beautifier
This stand alone project was inspired by the spirit of decentralization.
An open resource to parse and display csv files in a customizable AngularJS format.
Although bitcoin.tax does a fine job of calculating cost basis and capital gains,
I felt a project where users can download and run calculations locally falls more 
in line with crypto.
